# Perth

This is a responsive web page that I have created to showcase my skills in Frontend Development. 

Check out my output:

## Methodologies I Used

I used SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) as my CSS Preprocessor and ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) as my code architecture.

I also used BEM (Block Element Modifier) to add maintainability and reusability to the code.

## Technologies I Used

I used Gulp.js as my css compiler so that I don't need to use a separate compiler for my JS.

By the way, we usually don't upload dist folder but I did so I can host this to Github pages. :)

## Source

This is a free flat web design from [Blaz Robar](http://blazrobar.com/free-psd-website-templates/freebie-psd-perth-free-flat-web-design/). 

Thank you, Blaz Robar! ^____^

P.S. One of the fonts used on the design isn't free; hence, I just used Open Sans. :)
