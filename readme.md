# Perth

This is a web page that I have created to showcase my skills in Frontend Development.

## Methodologies I Used

I used SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) as my CSS Preprocessor and ITCSS (Inverted Triangle CSS) as my code architecture.

I also used BEM (Block Element Modifier) to add maintainability and reusability to the code.
